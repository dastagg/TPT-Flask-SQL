# Talk Python Training - Flask w/SQLAlchemy 

## [Flask w/SQLAlchemy](https://training.talkpython.fm/courses/explore_flask/building-data-driven-web-applications-in-python-with-flask-sqlalchemy-and-bootstrap)


### Course Summary
One of the areas Python really shines is in building clean and powerful web applications. Once you know the language basics, this course will teach you everything you need to build data-driven, modern web applications in Python with the Flask web framework.

### Take 2?
While I am familiar with Git and GitHub/GitLab/BitBucket and creating Issues, I am NOT familiar with Pull Requests.

So, with this version, I will re-visit this tutorial but pretend I am two different persons.

As I progress through the tutorial:
  - Create an issue
  - Create a branch
  - Complete that part of the tutorial
  - Push to GitHub
  - Create a PR
  - Merge (or not) the PR
  - Re-Sync the two local repositories
